# Who We Are

Yhe Nature Conservancy of Canada (NCC) is Canada's leading national land conservation organization. 
A private, non-profit organization, we partner with individuals, corporations, foundations, Indigenous 
communities and other non-profit organizations and governments at all levels to protect our most important 
natural treasures — the natural areas that sustain Canada’s plants and wildlife. We secure properties 
(through donation, purchase, conservation agreement and the relinquishment of other legal interests in land) 
and manage them for the long term.

Since 1962, NCC and its partners have helped to protect more than 15 million hectares, coast to coast to coast.
